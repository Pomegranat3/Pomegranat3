        <p>This was a a game I worked on for the 2024 PirateSoftware GameJam! A few friends and I got together to design this simple Roguelike/Hack and Slash. We made it over the course of a week and I learned a lot when it comes to making game design docs along with general production in a team. The themes were Shadows and Alchemy and I think we did a pretty good job executing the process!</p>
